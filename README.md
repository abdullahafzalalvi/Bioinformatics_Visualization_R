Overview

BioinformaticsPlotGallery is an R-based collection of commonly used bioinformatics visualizations with an emphasis on biological interpretation, reproducibility, and publication-quality figures. The repository is designed as both a practical reference for researchers and a portfolio project demonstrating applied R skills in genomics and transcriptomics.

Each plot is implemented as a standalone R script, uses realistic public datasets, and includes guidance on how results are interpreted in real research workflows.

Objectives

The main goals of this project are:

To provide reproducible R scripts for essential bioinformatics plots

To demonstrate correct interpretation of genomic and transcriptomic visualizations

To follow coding and visualization practices commonly used in published research

To serve as a professional GitHub portfolio for bioinformatics and data analysis roles

Included Visualizations

The repository covers plots routinely used in genomics and computational biology:

Volcano plots for differential gene expression

MA plots for expression bias assessment

Heatmaps for gene expression clustering

PCA plots for dimensionality reduction and batch detection

Q-Q plots for p-value distribution assessment

Manhattan plots for GWAS results

Box plots for group-wise gene expression comparison

Kaplan–Meier survival curves

Sequence alignment score visualizations

Each script generates figures suitable for reports, theses, or journal submission.
